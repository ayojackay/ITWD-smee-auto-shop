# Bootstrap project
A pet project to learn more about Bootstrap and discover new ways to design faster and easier. This is a temporary project that will be removed shortly after class ends - fork while you can!

## Smee's Auto Shop
In this project, we're building an auto shop for a business named after my pet's nickname. It will be multipage website with three main pages: landing page(index), Services, and Contact Us. Using this idea, we'll be able to explore and use some of [Bootstrap's components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components), [more utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/background/), and [helper classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/helpers/clearfix/)
